### Good Code

### Bad Code
One part of my code which I concider very bad is the calculation of high score. This has partly to do with the time I spent on it and the group collective idea that this aspect of the game should not be prioritized, but needs to be included in the final result. We wanted players to get a score when they die, and when they win the game. The score calculation per now is the amount of experience (XP) you have gathered divided on the total playing time.
