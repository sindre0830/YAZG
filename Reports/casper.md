### Bad code


### Good code
Although I didnâ€™t write a lot of code, I am happy with the code that I did write. The vendingmachine does what its supost do do, using as little resorces as posible while being simple to read and understand. 




### Reflection






One of the reasons for this is that in the beginning of the project we each got a task, mine happened to be related to map making, and so I became good at how Godot worked regards to this. 



How long new futures takes to implement. 
Trunk based dev
How important communication is. (Had often meeting)
